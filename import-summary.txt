ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ant.properties
* antRelease.bat
* build.xml
* releaseKey

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\android-query-full.0.26.7.jar => app\libs\android-query-full.0.26.7.jar
* libs\apache.jar => app\libs\apache.jar
* libs\armeabi\libgdx.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libgdx.so
* libs\gdx-backend-android.jar => app\libs\gdx-backend-android.jar
* libs\gdx.jar => app\libs\gdx.jar
* libs\jsoup-1.4.1.jar => app\libs\jsoup-1.4.1.jar
* libs\Platform_Android.jar => app\libs\Platform_Android.jar
* libs\QuickDevelop2D_AndroidEntry.jar => app\libs\QuickDevelop2D_AndroidEntry.jar
* libs\QuickDevelop2D_CIL.jar => app\libs\QuickDevelop2D_CIL.jar
* libs\QuickDevelop2D_Engine.jar => app\libs\QuickDevelop2D_Engine.jar
* libs\smalljs.jar => app\libs\smalljs.jar
* libs\vivo_adsdk_v2.6.4.jar => app\libs\vivo_adsdk_v2.6.4.jar
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* proguard.cfg => app\proguard.cfg
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
